### Using DevContainers

1. **Open the project in a DevContainer**
   - Click on the "Open in Dev Containers" button at the top of this README.
   - This will open the project in a new DevContainer with all the necessary configurations.

2. **Build the DevContainer**
   - If you are prompted to rebuild or reopen the project in a container, click "Yes" to rebuild.
   - This will install all the necessary dependencies and tools.

3. **Launch the DevContainer**
   - Once the DevContainer is built, you can launch it.
   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container".
   - This will restart the DevContainer and launch it.

4. **Run the MedusaJS Server**
   - Once the DevContainer is launched, open a new terminal within VS Code.
   - Run the following command to start the MedusaJS server:
     ```sh
     yarn run dev
     ```
     This will start the MedusaJS server on your local machine.
     - You can access the server at `http://localhost:9000` and `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
